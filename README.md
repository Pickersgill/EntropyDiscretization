# EntropyDiscretization
Discretization of data set based on maximizing entropy.

# Usage

Give the source dataset (MUST BE A LINE SEPORATED LIST OF INTEGERS) as argument to run.py:

```
python3 run.py dataset/my_data_set
```

Recommended to use dataset/gen\_nums.py to repopulate the dataset if you wish to do so.
